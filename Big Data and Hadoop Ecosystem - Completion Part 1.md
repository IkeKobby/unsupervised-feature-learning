## 2. The Hadoop Ecosystem (continued)

### What is Hadoop?
Hadoop is an open-source framework designed to store and process big data in a distributed environment. It provides massive storage for any kind of data, enormous processing power, and the ability to handle virtually limitless concurrent tasks.

Key characteristics:
- **Open Source**: Free to use and modify under the Apache License
- **Distributed Processing**: Processes data across clusters of computers
- **Fault Tolerance**: Can recover from hardware failures without data loss
- **Scalability**: Can scale from a single server to thousands of machines
- **Cost-Effective**: Uses commodity hardware rather than specialized equipment

### HDFS (Hadoop Distributed File System)
HDFS is the primary storage system used by Hadoop applications. It creates multiple replicas of data blocks and distributes them across cluster nodes to enable reliable and rapid computations.

#### Architecture Components:
1. **NameNode**: The master node that manages the file system namespace and regulates client access to files
2. **DataNode**: Stores actual data in HDFS; each cluster typically has multiple DataNodes
3. **Block**: The minimum amount of data that HDFS can read or write (typically 128 MB)
4. **Rack**: A physical collection of DataNodes, typically connected to the same network switch

#### Key Features:
- **High Availability**: Supports NameNode HA to eliminate single points of failure
- **Data Replication**: Default replication factor of 3 ensures data durability
- **Write-Once-Read-Many**: Optimized for high throughput over low latency
- **Large Block Size**: Minimizes seek time and reduces metadata overhead

### MapReduce
MapReduce is a programming model and processing technique for distributed computing. It enables massive scalability across hundreds or thousands of servers in a Hadoop cluster.

#### Process Flow:
1. **Map Phase**: Each node applies the map function to local data and writes the output to temporary storage
2. **Shuffle Phase**: The system distributes map outputs to nodes where reduction tasks will be performed
3. **Reduce Phase**: Each node performs the reduce function to process data received from map tasks

#### Benefits:
- **Parallelism**: Enables automatic parallelization and distribution
- **Fault Tolerance**: Automatically handles failures and restarts tasks
- **Locality of Data**: Moves computation to where data resides to minimize network congestion
- **Balanced Workload**: Manages task allocation to ensure even load distribution

### YARN (Yet Another Resource Negotiator)
YARN is the resource management layer of Hadoop, providing APIs for requesting and working with cluster resources.

#### Components:
1. **ResourceManager**: The ultimate authority that arbitrates resources among all applications
2. **NodeManager**: Responsible for containers, monitoring resource usage, and reporting to the ResourceManager
3. **ApplicationMaster**: Application-specific entity negotiating resources from the ResourceManager
4. **Container**: A collection of physical resources (memory, CPU, disk, network, etc.)

#### Features:
- **Multi-tenancy**: Allows multiple engines to use Hadoop simultaneously
- **Scalability**: Can scale to thousands of nodes and tens of thousands of applications
- **Compatibility**: Maintains backward compatibility with MapReduce applications
- **Resource Optimization**: Dynamically allocates resources based on application needs

## 3. Core Components of the Hadoop Ecosystem (continued)

### Hive
Apache Hive is a data warehouse infrastructure built on top of Hadoop for providing data summarization, query, and analysis. It provides an SQL-like interface called HiveQL.

#### Key Features:
- **SQL-like Queries**: HiveQL provides a familiar interface for SQL users
- **Schema on Read**: Supports schema evolution and flexibility
- **Extensibility**: Custom functions (UDFs, UDAFs, UDTFs) can be written in Java
- **Indexing**: Improves query performance through various indexing techniques
- **Storage Formats**: Supports various file formats including Text, Parquet, ORC, Avro

### Pig
Apache Pig is a high-level platform for creating programs that run on Hadoop. It provides a scripting language called Pig Latin.

#### Advantages:
- **Simplified Programming**: Pig Latin abstracts the complexity of MapReduce
- **Built-in Operators**: Rich set of operators for common data operations
- **Extensibility**: User-defined functions can be written in Java, Python, etc.
- **Optimization**: The Pig engine optimizes execution automatically
- **Handles Data Types**: Works with both structured and unstructured data

### HBase
Apache HBase is a non-relational distributed database modeled after Google's BigTable. It runs on top of HDFS and provides real-time read/write access to large datasets.

#### Features:
- **Column-oriented**: Stores data tables as sections of columns rather than rows
- **Scalability**: Easily scales horizontally by adding more nodes
- **Consistent Reads/Writes**: Provides strong consistency guarantees
- **Automatic Sharding**: Distributes data across multiple servers automatically
- **Sparse Data Storage**: Efficiently handles sparse data through column families

### ZooKeeper
Apache ZooKeeper is a centralized service for maintaining configuration information, naming, providing distributed synchronization, and providing group services.

#### Use Cases:
- **Configuration Management**: Centralized storage for configurations
- **Leader Election**: Helps in selecting a leader among a group of nodes
- **Distributed Locking**: Provides mechanisms for implementing locks in distributed systems
- **Cluster Management**: Keeps track of nodes in the cluster
- **Naming Service**: Acts like a DNS for the cluster

### Flume
Apache Flume is a distributed, reliable, and available service for efficiently collecting, aggregating, and moving large amounts of log data.

#### Architecture:
- **Source**: Receives data from an external source
- **Channel**: Temporary storage between source and sink
- **Sink**: Delivers data to its final destination (often HDFS)
- **Agent**: A JVM process containing the source, channel, and sink

### Sqoop
Apache Sqoop is a tool designed for efficiently transferring bulk data between Apache Hadoop and structured datastores such as relational databases.

#### Capabilities:
- **Import/Export**: Moves data between HDFS and RDBMS
- **Parallel Operation**: Transfers data using multiple mappers for better performance
